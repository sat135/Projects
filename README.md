## 2. ML Image Classification
A robust classifier, able to detect whether an image consists of Daylight Sky, Night Sky, or No sky at all.

Features:

This model will find use in recognizing and separating the sky from the rest of the objects on the photo. Once a picture is taken, the application by itself will recognize if there is a sky at all, and then recognize if it is a day or night in order to identify if sky-algorithm should be offered as an option to the user to edit the sky.

Fully writen in Python.
